_Alex is a guy who wants to know who is hiring who for what. Let's scrape jobs for Alex?_

## Webscraping

Webscraping is fun. Webscraping also sits on the thin wall between legal and illegal. Webscraping can be hard!

I'll begin a series of funny challenges aimed at displaying the intricate art of webscraping. I'll mostly use Python and several packages written for the purpose of webscraping.

This repo will scrape jobs in Utah, initially from KSL and Indeed. I might include a statistical summary of the results. Oh, and a simple SQLite database will be used to store all the results.

That's it, let's scrape!
